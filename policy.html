				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="text-box">
				<p>Welcome to Clozina.com (our “Website”), an interactive online service operated by Clozina (“us”, “we” or “our”). Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy, which includes compliance with California Privacy Rights</p>
				<br>
				<p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide to us through our Website (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise). We have adopted this Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information and under what circumstances we may disclose this information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through our Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or other social media platforms.</p>
				<br>
				<p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms of Use posted on our Website, sets forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>
				<br>
				<p>We generally keep this Privacy Policy posted on our Website and you should review it periodically, as it may change from time to time without notice. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy. WHEN YOU ACCESS OUR WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, OR TO ANY CHANGES WE MAY SUBSEQUENTLY MAKE, IMMEDIATELY STOP ACCESSING OUR WEBSITE. If at any point we decide to use your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users of this change by email to the last email address provided to us. Users will have a choice (by means of an opt-out opportunity) as to whether or not we use their personally identifiable information in this different manner. If you opt-out of the new policy, we will use personally identifiable information in accordance with the privacy policy under which such personally identifiable information was collected.</p>
				<br><br><br>
				<h3>A. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
				<br>
				<p>Our definition of personally identifiable information includes any information that may be used to specifically identify or contact you, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, etc. As a general policy, we do not automatically collect your personally identifiable information when you visit our Website. In certain circumstances, we may request, allow or otherwise provide you with an opportunity to submit your personally identifiable information in connection with a feature, program, promotion or some other aspect of our Website. For instance, you may: (i) provide your name, mailing/shipping address, email address, credit card number and phone number when registering with our Website, using our online store or in connection with a contest entry; (ii) provide certain demographic information (e.g., your age, gender, purchase preference, usage frequency, etc.) when participating in a survey, poll or joining a club; or (iii) post a product rating and recommendation on our Website. Certain information may not be personally identifiable when standing alone (e.g., your age), but may become so when combined with other information (e.g., your age and name). Whether or not you provide this information is your choice; however, in many instances this type of information is required to participate in the particular activity, realize a benefit we may offer or gain access to certain content on our Website.</p>
				<br><br>
				<h4>2. Non-Personal Information:</h4>
				<br>
				<p>Our definition of non-personal information is any information that does not personally identify you. Non-personal information can include certain personally identifiable information that has been de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered anonymous. We and/or our third-party service providers obtain non-personal information about you from information that you provide us, either separately or together with your personally identifiable information. We also automatically collect certain non-personal information from you when you access our Website. This information can include, among other things, IP addresses (or some other unique identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet), the type of browser you are using, the third-party website from which your visit originated, the operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, the search terms you use on our Website, the specific web pages you visit and the duration of your visits.</p>
				<br><br><br>
				<h3>B. HOW WE USE AND SHARE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>
				<br>
				<h4>1. Personally Identifiable Information:</h4>
				<br>
				<p>The personally identifiable information you submit to us is generally used to carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries or in other ways naturally associated with the circumstances in which you provide the information. We may also use this information to later contact you for a variety of reasons, such as customer service, providing you with promotional information for our products or those of our affiliated companies (“affiliated companies”), or to communicate with you about content or other information you have posted or shared with us via our Website. You may opt-out from receiving future promotional information from us or our affiliated companies, or direct that we not share your information with any affiliated companies, as set forth below.</p>
				<br>
				<p>In certain instances we may also share your personally identifiable information with our third-party vendors performing functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our affiliated companies) (e.g., vendors that process credit card orders, deliver merchandise, administer our promotions, provide us with marketing or promotional assistance, analyze our data, assist us with customer service, etc.). Our vendors agree to use this information, and we share this information with them, only to carry out our requests. In addition, we may share your personally identifiable information with participating sponsors to a program or promotion (e.g., a sweepstakes or contest) you enter via our Website, and with third parties who assist us in using the content or other information you have posted or shared with us via our Website (e.g., production companies we may use). Further, we may share your personally identifiable information with third parties such as our co-promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, or as set forth when you submit the information, your personally identifiable information will not be shared or sold to any third parties without your prior approval.</p>
				<br><br>
				<h4>2. Non-Personal Information:</h4>
				<br>
				<p>In addition to any personally identifiable information or other information that you choose to provide to us on our Website, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies, now and hereafter devised, that automatically collect certain non-personal information whenever you visit or interact with our Website. We collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report non-personal aggregate information to others, and to track the use of our Website. It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable; that is, the visitor’s session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us. However, we reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Website rules or to: (i) fulfill a government request; (ii) conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; (iii) protect or defend our legal rights or property, our Website or other users; or (iv) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of our Website’s users or the general public.</p>
				<br>
				<p>We use non-personal information in a variety of ways, including to help analyze site traffic, understand user needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional activities and to improve our products and services. We may use your non-personal information by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from others. We may share your non-personal information with our affiliated companies and third parties to achieve these objectives and others, but remember that aggregate information is anonymous information that does not personally identify you. Website usage information may be collected using various methods, such as the following:</p>
				<br>
				<p>(a) Cookies, etc.:</p>
				<br>
				<p>“Cookies” are small text files from a website that are stored on your hard drive. These text files make using our Website more convenient by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you. Cookies themselves do not typically contain any personally identifiable information. We may analyze the information derived from these cookies and other technological tools we employ (such as clear gifs/web beacons) and match this information with data provided by you or another party. We may provide our analysis and certain non-personal information to third parties (who may in turn use this information to provide advertisements tailored to your interests), but this will not involve disclosing any of your personally identifiable information. Please note that advertisers that serve advertisements on our Website may also use their own cookies and other technological tools which are subject to the advertiser’s privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy. If you are concerned about the storage and use of cookies, you may be able to direct your Internet browser to notify you and seek approval whenever a cookie is being sent to your hard drive. You may also delete a cookie manually from your hard drive through your Internet browser or other programs. Please note, however, that some parts of our Website will not function properly or be available to you if you refuse to accept a cookie or choose to disable the acceptance of cookies.</p>
				<br>
				<p>(b) Web Beacons:</p>
				<br>
				<p>Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and email messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including to count visitors to our Website, to monitor how users navigate our Website, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
				<br>
				<p>(c) Mobile Device Identifiers:</p>
				<br>
				<p>Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile devices and we or our third-party service providers may receive such device information if you access our Website through mobile devices. Certain features of our Website may require collection of mobile phone numbers, and we may associate that phone number to mobile device identification information. Additionally, some mobile phone service providers operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on the provider, we or our third-party service providers may receive this information.</p>
				<br>
				<p>(d) Embedded Scripts:</p>
				<br>
				<p>An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with our Website, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to our Website and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
